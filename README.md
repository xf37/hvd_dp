# Allocation using a heterogeneous space Voronoi diagram

In this repo, we introduce the concept of spatial heterogeneity in allocation. A new dynamic programming-based Voronoi diagram is definedâ€”the heterogeneous Voronoi diagram. A geographic information system-based method is developed to derive the heterogeneous Voronoi diagram using discretized spatial allocation properties. Application of the heterogeneous Voronoi diagram is reported for a planning problem involving emergency drone delivery. Results show that response potential is over- and underestimated when heterogeneity and travel obstacles are disregarded. Further, feasibility, usefulness, and significance are demonstrated for incorporating geographic heterogeneity in the allocation process.
